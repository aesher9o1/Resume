His front-end development skills have helped us to deliver effectively and efficiently. JavaScript, Angular, and CSS are his forte. He is always polite and calm while communicating. Although a self learner he is also teachable and ready to learn new things whenever required. Anybody would be lucky to have Aashis as a team member. As a front-end developer, Aashis earns my highest recommendation",
